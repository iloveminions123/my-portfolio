    Marie Curie was born to Polish family in 1867. She later moved to France and faced discrimination as a woman and an immigrant. She later became a revered figure in the science community for her pioneering studies on radiation. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in 1934. She died at an earlier age due to her overexposure to radiation.
